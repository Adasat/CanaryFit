## Introduction

Welcome to Canary Fit, your personal fitness companion! Canary Fit is an application designed for individuals with little experience in the fitness world, making it easy and accessible to create customized exercise routines based on various goals and workout styles. The application provides a wide range of exercises, each accompanied by a detailed description, proper execution gifs, and recommendations to prevent injuries.

Are you looking to build strength, tone your muscles, or improve your overall fitness? Canary Fit has got you covered! Whether you're a beginner or an enthusiast, our application will guide you through the process of achieving your fitness objectives with ease.

## Technologies

Canary Fit is built using the MERN stack, which includes the following technologies:

- MongoDB: A powerful NoSQL database used for storing exercise routines, user profiles, and other relevant data.

- Express: A flexible and minimalist web application framework for Node.js, facilitating the development of the server-side components.

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling us to create an interactive and responsive front-end.

- Node.js: A runtime environment that allows us to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, essential for server-side development.

In addition to the MERN stack, we leverage the Next.js framework based on React to enhance the application's performance and enable server-side rendering. The user interface is styled using Tailwind CSS, providing a clean and modern aesthetic.
